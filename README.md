<h3> Projects I have worked on : </h3>

- From November 2022 to March 2023, I worked on simulation of two phase flows through the Lattice Boltzmann method in the C++ code LBM_saclay during an internship at CEA.

- From April 2023 to August  2023, during an internship in the group Geometric Numerical Integration and Reduced Complexity Modelling (in the division Numerical Modeling in Plasma Physics at Max Planck), I worked on Scientifique Machine Learning (PINN's).  I focused on different architectures as HNN, LNN, SympNet, RNN and LSTM with contributions in different Julia packages 
    - GeometricMachineLearning.jl,
    - AbstractNeuralNetworks.jl, 
    - EulerLagrange.jl, 
    - SymbolicNeuralNetwork.jl.
